	\title{Ramsey Theory on Graphs}
	\author{Hern√°n Ibarra Mejia}
	\maketitle
	
	\chapter{Introduction and Classical Results}
	This is a set of lecture notes taken by me from the Part III course ``Ramsey Theory on Graphs'', lectured by Dr J. Sahasrabudhe in Michaelmas, 2023. I take full responsibility for any mistakes in these notes.
	
	We fix some notation first. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define, for all positive integers $n$,
		\[[n]\coloneqq \{1,2,\ldots, n\}.\]
		\item $K_n$ denotes the complete graph on $n$ vertices, i.e. 
		\[
			V(K_n)= [n] \text{ and }E(K_n) = \{\{i,j\} \colon i\neq j \text{ and }i,j\in [n]\}.
		\] 
		\item If $X$ is a set and $r\in \mathbb{N}$, let
		\[
			X^{(r)} \coloneqq \{S\subseteq X \colon |S| = r\}.
		\]
		\item Functions $\chi\colon E(K_n) \to [k]$ are called $k$-colourings of (the edges of) $K_n$.  If $k = 2$ we sometimes instead give names to the colours, i.e. we consider functions $E(K_n) \to \{\text{red}, \text{blue}\}$.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{The Ramsey Numbers}
	\subsection{Definitions}
	Here is the big picture question
	\begin{center}
		What can we say about the structure of an arbitrary 2-colouring of $E(K_n)$?
	\end{center}
	A priori it seems that nothing can be said: an arbitrary 2-colouring is disordered and random. However, we will see that order arises even in these circumstances. 
	
	Say that a colouring $\chi \colon E(K_n) \to [r]$ contains a monochromatic clique\footnote{``Clique'' is another word for a complete graph.} of size $k$ if there is a subgraph $G$ of $K_n$, isomorphic to $K_k$, such that $\restr{\chi}{E(G)}$ is constant. In other words, inside $K_n$ there is a smaller complete graph $K_k$ that $\chi$ colours with only colour. When $k=2$ sometimes we speak of the colouring $\chi$ containing a red (or blue) clique or size $k$; this just means that $\chi$ contains a monochromatic clique $G$ so that $\restr{\chi}{E(G)}$ is constant with value red (respectively blue). Usually we will say a colouring of $K_n$ when we mean a colouring of $E(K_n)$, for the sake of simplicity (all of our colourings will be edge-colourings).
	
	Consider the following example.
	\begin{eg}
		In any party of six people, there are three people who are (pairwise) already acquainted or are (pairwise) meeting for the first time. Indeed, call one of the people $A$. Then there are five other people at the party who either $A$ knows already or $A$ is meeting for first time. By the pigeonhole principle, $A$ knew 3 people or $A$ didn't know 3 people; call them $X,Y$ and $Z$. Without loss of generality, assume $A$ knew them (the other case is similar).
		
		Then if there are two people from the set $\{X,Y,Z\}$ that know each other then, together with $A$, they would for a group of three people that know each other. Otherwise, $X,Y$ and $Z$ are mutual strangers and we are done.
		
		Examine this argument. We have shown that a complete graph on six vertices always has a monochromatic clique of size three. Remarkable, isn't it?
	\end{eg}
	So does this always happen? Can we always find a monochromatic clique of size $k$ in a colouring of $K_n$? If $n$ is large enough, Ramsey says yes. Define the \emph{diagonal Ramsey numbers} as 
	\begin{multline*}
		R(k) \coloneqq \min\{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\colon \text{All 2-colourings of $K_n$ have}\\ \text{a monochromatic clique of size $k$}\},
	\end{multline*}
	for all $k\in \mathbb{Z}^+$. We showed that all colourings of $K_6$ contain a monochromatic clique of size 3, i.e. that $R(3) \leq 6$. We actually have $R(3) = 6$. To see this, note that if all colourings of $K_n$ contain a monochromatic clique of size $k$ then all colourings of $K_m$ contain a monochromatic clique of size $k$ for all $m\geq n$ (just remove $m-n$ vertices and apply the hypothesis). Contrapositively, if a colouring of $K_5$ does not contain a clique of size $3$ then nor does a colouring of $K_n$ for all $n\in [4]$. And indeed this is the case, as the {\color{red}{following}} Figure shows. It follows that $R(3)=6$. 
	\begin{center}
		\color{red}{Figure: $K_5$ coloured with no monochromatic clique of size 3}
	\end{center}
	Before we move one, we will generalize our definition slightly. For positive integers $k$ and $l$, define the \emph{Ramsey numbers} to be
	\begin{multline*}
		R(l,k) = \min\{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\colon \text{All 2-colourings of $K_n$ contain either}\\ \text {a blue clique of size $l$ or a red clique of size $k$}\}.
	\end{multline*}
	Clearly $R(l,k) = R(k,l)$ by symmetry and $R(k,k) = R(k)$ for all $l,k$. 
	\subsection{Ramsey's Theorem}
	If you haven't noticed already, you should know that there is a problem with out definition of Ramsey numbers and diagonal Ramsey numbers. Both are defined as a minimum of a subset of the naturals, yet we did not prove that the subsets are non-empty. In other words, how can we be sure that there isn't some $k$ such that for all $n$ we have that there is a colouring of $K_n$ with no monochromatic $k$-clique? (similarly for the more general Ramsey numbers). Thus, our first task will be to verify that these numbers are well-defined. It suffices to focus on the general Ramsey numbers, since the diagonal Ramsey numbers are special case of them.
	
	We will do so recursively: first we show that $R(l,k)$ well-defined for small values of $k$ and $l$, and then we will use a recursive upper bound to show that all this is true for all values of $k$ and $l$.
	
	Obviously $R(1,1) = 1$. Furthermore, $R(2,1) = R(1,2) = 1$ which you can easily check. Finally, $R(2,2)= 2$. This is enough to show the following.
	\begin{thm}[Ramsey's Theorem]\label{thm:ramsey}
		For all positive integers $k$ and $l$, the Ramsey number $R(l,k)$ is well-defined. Furthermore, if $l,k\geq 2$ we have
		\[
			R(l,k) \leq R(l-1,k) + R(l,k-1).
		\] 
	\end{thm} 
	\begin{proof}
		Induction on $l+k$. We know $R(l,k)$ is well-defined for $l+k = 2$ so the base case (when $l=k=1$) is done. By inductive hypothesis both $a\coloneqq R(l-1, k)$ and $b = R(l,k-1)$ are well-defined. Let $n\coloneqq a+b$. We will show that any colouring of a graph with $n$ vertices has either a blue $l$-clique or a red $k$-clique. This will prove that $R(l,k)$ is well-defined and further $R(l,k) \leq n$, which is what we want.
		
		So, let $\chi \colon E(K_n) \to \{\text{red},\text{blue}\}$ be a colouring and let $x$ be an arbitrary vertex of $K_n$. By $N_B(x)$ we denote the set of vertices that are adjacent to $x$ by a blue edge, and similarly for $N_R(x)$.
		
		Note that $|N_B(x)| + |N_R(x)|$ is just the degree of $x$, i.e. $n-1$. It follows that either $|N_B(x)| \geq a$ or $|N_R(x)|\geq b$ for if we had both $|N_B(x)| \leq a- 1$ and $|N_r(x)|\leq b-1$ then
		\[
			n-1 = |N_B(x)| + |N_R(x)| \leq (a - 1) + (b-1)  = n-2,
		\]
		a contradiction. There are two cases then.
		\subsubsection*{Case 1}
		The number of blue neighbours of $x$ is at least $a$, i.e. $|N_B(x)|\geq a$. By definition of $a$, the subgraph induced by $|N_B(a)|$ contains a red $k$-clique or a blue $(l-1)$-clique. In the former case we are done: we have found a red $k$-clique. In the latter case, we note that if we adjoin the vertex $x$ to the blue $(l-1)$-clique in $N_B(x)$ we get a blue $l$-clique in $K_n$.
		\subsubsection*{Case 2}
		The number of red neighbours of $x$ is at least $b$. This case is done completely analogously to Case 1.
	\end{proof}
	\section{Bounds on Ramsey Numbers}
	\subsection{Upper Bounds}
	Note that $R(l,2) =l$ and $R(2,k) = k$ for all $l$ and $k$. We can use the recursive bound to give us a non-recursive bound.
	\begin{thm}[Erd≈ës-Szekeres, 1935]\label{thm:ram_up_bound_binom}
		For all positive integers $l,k$ we have
		\[
			R(l,k) \leq \binom{l+k-2}{l-1}
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		Again, we do induction on $l+k$. The base case is trivial. By Theorem \ref{thm:ramsey} and the inductive hypothesis
		\begin{align*}
			R(l,k) &= R(l-1,k) + R(l,k-1)\\
			&\leq \binom{l+k - 3}{l-2} + \binom{l+k - 3}{l-1}\\
			&= \binom{l+k - 2}{l -1},
		\end{align*}
		where in the last equality we used the identity $\binom{n + 1}{m+1} = \binom{n}{m+1} + \binom{n}{m}$.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{coro}
		For all positive integers $k$,
		\[
			R(k) \leq \binom{2k - 2}{k- 1} \leq c\frac{4^k}{\sqrt{k}}
		\]
		for some constant $c>0$.
	\end{coro}
	\begin{proof}
		The first inequality is just Theorem \ref{thm:ram_up_bound_binom} for the case $l=k$. For the second one we can approximate using Stirling's formula or by clever formulae-manipulation, see e.g. \href{https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/2n_choose_n/}{this link}.
	\end{proof}
	So roughly we can bound $R(k)$ by something that grows like $4^k$. Is this close to how $R(k)$ really grows?
	
	\subsection{Lower bounds}
	For some time people thought $4^k$ was far from the truth and that the growth of $R(k)$ should be polynomial. Indeed, it is easy to get a quadratic lower bound for $R(k)$. The rough idea is to take $(k-1)$ copies of a blue $K_{k-1}$ and connect all the remaining edges in red such that we end up with a $K_{(k-1)^2}$ with no monochromatic $k$-clique. Erd≈ës surprised everyone by providing an exponential lower bound, and by furthermore introducing a non-standard (back then) proof technique, now known as the ``probabilistic method''.
	
	We will use binomial coefficients quite a bit, so the following bounds will be useful.
	\begin{prop}\label{prop:binom_st_bound}
		For all $n,k\in\mathbb{N}$ with $k\leq n$ we have
		\[
		\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^k \leq \binom{n}{k}\leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^k
		\]
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}
		For the lower bound we note that
		\begin{align}
			\binom{n}{k} &= \frac{n}{k} \cdot \frac{n-1}{k-1} \cdots \frac{n-k+1}{1}\notag\\
			&= \prod_{m=0}^{k-1}\frac{n - m}{k-m} \label{eq:binom_prod}
		\end{align}
		We would like to show that all of the factors in the product are bounded below by $n/k$. Indeed, as $k\leq n$ we have $km \leq nm$ for all $0\leq m \leq k-1$, and so $km - nk \leq nm - nk$. Rewriting the latter we get $k(m - n)\leq n(m-k)$ which, negating both sides and reordering we get
		\[
		\frac{n-m}{k-m} \geq \frac{n}{k} \text{ for all }0\leq m \leq k-1.
		\]
		This implies the lower bound.
		
		For the upper bound take the representation in equation (\ref{eq:binom_prod}). As $n-m \leq n$ for $0\leq m\leq k-1$ we get 
		\begin{equation*}
			\binom{n}{k}\leq \frac{n^k}{k!}
		\end{equation*}
		Now notice that 
		\[
		e^k = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{k^i}{i!} \geq \frac{k^k}{k!}.
		\]
		Therefore $\frac{1}{k!}\leq \left(\frac{e}{k}\right)^k$ and so we get
		\[
		\binom{n}{k} \leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)
		\]
		as desired.
	\end{proof}
	Now we can prove the result by Erd≈ës. I know the bound seems intimidating but the idea of the proof is simple enough: just pick a random colouring and analyse what is the probability of getting (or not getting) the colouring you want. The bound follows naturally from this approach.
	\begin{thm}[Erd≈ës, 1948]
		For all $0<\varepsilon < 1$ there is some $k$ large enough so that
		\[
			R(k) \geq (1 - \varepsilon) \frac{k}{e\sqrt{2}}2^{k/2}.
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $0<\varepsilon <1$. We will later see how big $k$ needs to be, so for now assume it to be arbitrary. Define
		\[
			n \coloneqq \left\lfloor (1-\varepsilon)\frac{k2^{k/2}}{e\sqrt{2}}\right\rfloor.
		\]
		(Again, this $n$ looks like it comes out of nowhere but it is picked such that most everything we get at the end is cancelled out). Let $\chi$ be a random red/blue colouring of $E(K_n)$, i.e. each edge has equal probability of being red and blue, and furthermore the choices for colours between different edges are independent. We will show that
		\[
			P \coloneqq \mathbb{P}(\chi \text{ contains a monochromatic $k$-clique}) < 1.
		\]
		This implies that there \emph{is} a colouring of $E(K_n)$ such that there is no monochromatic $k$-clique, i.e. that $R(k) > n$.
		
		By definition,
		\begin{equation*}
			P = \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{S\in[n]^{(k)}} \{S \text{ is monochromatic}\}\right)
		\end{equation*}
		We can apply the union bound, which says that the ``probability of the union is at most the sum of the probabilities''. For each $S\in [n]^(k)$ the probability that it is monochromatic is the sum of the probability that it is completely red and the probability that it is completely blue; both of these cases have probability $\frac{1}{2^{\binom{k}{2}}}$. Thus we have
		\[
			P \leq \binom{n}{k}2^{1-\binom{k}{2}}
		\]
		Using the standard bound for the binomial we get
		\begin{align*}
			P &\leq 2\left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^k\cdot 2^{\frac{-k(k-1)}{2}}\\
			&= 2\left(\frac{e\sqrt{2}n}{k}2^{-k/2}\right)^k\\
			&\leq 2(1-\varepsilon)^k,
		\end{align*}
		where we used the definition of $n$ in the last inequality. Hence it is clear that $P$ can be made arbitrarily small as for large enough $k$; so definitely we can pick $k$ with $P<1$. Thus, we have determined that $R(k)>n$ which implies, since $R(k)$ is an integer, that
		\[
			R(k)\geq (1-\varepsilon)\frac{k2^{k/2}}{e\sqrt{2}}.\qedhere
		\]
	\end{proof}
	In essence we have proven that, very roughly, $(\sqrt{2})^k \leq R(k) \leq 4^k$. What is the right base in the exponent? This is the big open question in Ramsey Theory.
	\chapter{On $R(3,k)$}
	Using the bounds on the previous chapter, we quickly deduce that
	\[
		R(3,k) \leq \binom{k+1}{2} \leq (k+1)^2.
	\]
	A quadratic growth happens to be indeed very close to the truth. We will try to get a quadratic lower bound in the next section. 
	\section{(Ab)using the the probabilistic method}
	As we are going to keep the value of $l$ fixed at 3 we will change how we think about colourings. Note that to find a lower bound $f(k) \leq R(3,k)$ it suffices to prove that a graph $G$ with $f(k)$ vertices exists that does not contain a triangle nor an independent set of size $k$. For if we had such a $G$ then we can construct a colouring of $K_{f(k)}$ that colours a copy of $G$ in $K_{f(k)}$ completely blue and all other edges red. Such a colouring will not have a blue triangle, since $G$ contains no triangles, and no red $k$-clique since that would imply $G$ has an independent $k$-set. Hence $f(k) \leq R(3,k)$ as desired.
	
	To find $G$ we could try to use the probabilistic method as we have before. That is, having $f(k)$ vertices, connect them randomly, with each edge having probability 1/2 to appear. Then we would show that such a random graph (up to certain modification, cf. the actual proof) has a non-zero probability of having no triangles and no independent $k$-sets.  The problem is that the probability turns out to be so close to zero it is difficult to prove that it must be non-zero using approximations like e.g., the union bound. The solution is to consider a random graph that is more likely to have fewer edges but not too few so as to have independent $k$-sets. This motivates the following definition.
	\begin{defn}[Binomial Random Graph]
		For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $p\in[0,1]$ we define the probability space $G(n,p)$ to be that on all graphs $[n]$ where each edge is independently included with probability $p$.
	\end{defn}
	So far we have considered $G(n,1/2)$. With this more general definition, it is possible to prove an OK lower bound. If $G$ is a graph, denote by $\alpha(G)$ the maximum $k$ so that $G$ contains an independent set of size $k$.
	\begin{thm}[Erd\H{o}s]
		There exists some constant $c>0$ such that for all $k$ we have
		\[
			R(3,k) \geq c\left(\frac{k}{\log k}\right)^{3/2}.
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		Define $n\coloneqq \left(\frac{k}{\log k}\right)^{3/2}$ and $p \coloneqq n^{-2/3} = \frac{\log k}{k}$. Forget about these values for now since it is not clear why they were chosen. 
		
		Sample a graph $G$ from the distribution $G(n,p)$ (henceforth we abbreviate this as $G\sim G(n,p)$). Define $\tilde{G}$ to be the graph $G$ but deleting all vertices that are part of a triangle or an independent set of size $k$. Then $\tilde{G}$ has no triangles and $\alpha(\tilde{G}) <k$ by construction. How many vertices are there left in $\tilde{G}$? We will show that
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq cn,
		\]
		for some constant $c>0$. Denote by $X$ the number of triangles in $G$ and $Y$ the number of independent sets of size $k$ in $G$. Then we clearly have
		\[
			|\tilde{G}| \geq n - X - Y.
		\]
		This is not necessarily equality because we can get ``lucky'' in that e.g., a vertex may be both part of a triangle and of an independent $k$-set, so we only delete it once (we can't delete it twice). The bound $n - X -Y$ is the worst possible scenario. We can take expectations on both sides of the inequality and use linearity to conclude
		\begin{equation}
			\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq n - \mathbb{E}(X) - \mathbb{E}(Y).
		\end{equation}
		We will now obtain bounds on $\mathbb{E}(X)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y)$.
		
		Observe that
		\[
			X = \sum_{T \in [n]^{(3)}}\mathbf{1}_{\{T\text{ forms a triangle in } G\}}.
		\]	
		Take expectations:
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{E}(X) &= \sum_{T \in [n]^{(3)}}\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{1}_{\{T\text{ forms a triangle in } G\}})\\
			&= \sum_{T \in [n]^{(3)}}\mathbb{P}(\{T\text{ forms a triangle in } G\})\\
			&= \sum_{T \in [n]^{(3)}} p^3 = \binom{n}{3}p^3.
		\end{align*}
		It immediately follows that $\mathbb{E}(X) \leq \frac{1}{6}(np)^3$. A similar method works for $Y$. First, write it as a sum of indicator functions:
		\[
			Y = \sum_{S \in [n]^{(k)}}\mathbf{1}_{\{S\text{ is an independet $k$-set in } G\}}.
		\]
		Take expectations and we get
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{E}(Y) &= \binom{n}{k}(1-p)^{\binom{k}{2}}\\
			&\leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^k (1-p)^{\binom{k}{2}}\\
			&\leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^k e^{-p\binom{k}{2}}\\
			&= \left(\frac{en}{k}e^{-p\left(\frac{k-1}{2}\right)}\right)^k\\
			&= \left(\frac{en}{k}e^{\frac{-pk}{2}}e^{\frac{p}{2}}\right)^k
		\end{align*}
		where the inequalities came from the standard bound on the binomial and the fact that $1-x \leq e^{-x}$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. As $0< p < 1$  it follows that $e^{p/2} < \sqrt{e} < 2$. Hence,
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(Y) \leq \left(\frac{2en}{k}e^{\frac{-pk}{2}}\right)^k.
		\]
		Therefore we get
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq n - \frac{1}{6}(np)^3 - \left(\frac{2en}{k}e^{\frac{-pk}{2}}\right)^k
		\]
		It is clear now that we need $(np)^3$ to grow like $n$; hence why the value of $p$ was chosen. A similar heuristic was used to choose the value of $n$. 
		
		In any case, replacing the value of $p$ (both in terms of $n$ and in terms of $k$) yield
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq n - \frac{n}{6} - \left(\frac{2en}{k^{3/2}}\right)^k
		\]
		Replacing the value of $n$ in terms of $k$ yields
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq \frac{5n}{6} - \left(\frac{2e}{(\log k)^{3/2}}\right)^k.
		\]
		And so it is clear that for large enough $k$ we have $\left(\frac{2e}{(\log k)^{3/2}}\right)^k$ being arbitrarily small, so definitely $\mathbb{E}(|\tilde{G}|) \geq cn$ for some $c>0$ and for large enough $k$. Thus, if $k$ is large enough, there is a graph $\tilde{G}$ with the desired properties and at least $cn$ vertices and so
		\[
			R(3,k) \geq cn
		\]
		for large enough $k$. To get the statement for all $k$ decrease $c$ while keeping it positive until it applies for all $k$.
	\end{proof}
	This was the ``vertex deletion method'': we deleted some vertices from the random graph to get one with the desired properties. However this is not efficient: our bound worsens when we delete vertices.
	
	What about deleting edges instead? This is much harder since one may inadvertently create independent sets while trying to delete triangles. Our idea will be to delete edges from collections of edge-disjoint triangles in $G\sim G(n,p)$ and remove all edges from these triangles.
	
	\begin{thm}[Erd\H{o}s]\label{thm:erd_r3k_lb}
		There exists some $c>0$ such for all $k$ we have
		\[
			R(3,k) \geq c \left(\frac{k}{\log k}\right)^2
		\]
	\end{thm}
	To prove this, we will need a couple of lemmata. 
	\begin{lem}\label{lem:t_indep_events}
		Let $\mathcal{F}=\{A_1,\ldots, A_m\}$ be a family of events in a probability space. Let $\mathcal{E}_t$ be the event that at least $t$ independent events from $\mathcal{F}$ occur. Then
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}_t) \leq \frac{1}{t!} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}\mathbb{P}(A_i)\right)^t.
		\]
	\end{lem}
	\begin{proof}
		Note that 
		\[\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{E}_t} = \frac{1}{t!}\sum_{\substack{(i_1,\ldots,i_t)\in [m]^{t},\\ A_{i_1},\ldots, A_{i_t} \text{are}\\ \text{distinct independent}\\ \text{events}}}\mathbf{1}_{A_{i_1}}\mathbf{1}_{A_{i_2}}\cdots \mathbf{1}_{A_{i_t}}.\]
		Take expectations on both sides. Note that the equality turns into an inequality if we delete the long condition on the sum.
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}_t) &\leq \frac{1}{t!} \sum_{(i_1,\ldots,i_t)\in [m]^{t}} \mathbb{P}(A_{i_1}) \cdots \mathbb{P}(A_{i_t})\\
			& \leq \frac{1}{t!}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\mathbb{P}(A_i)\right)^t\qedhere
		\end{align*}
	\end{proof}
	From now on we say a property $P$ holds of $G\sim G(n,p)$ with high probability (sometimes abbreviated as w.h.p) if 
	\[
		\mathbb{P}(G\text{ has property }P) \to 1 \text{ as }n\to \infty.
	\]
	\begin{lem}\label{lem:high_prob_edges}
		Let $n,k\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $p\in (0,1)$ be such that $pk \geq 16 \log n$. Then with high probability every subset of size $k$ of $G\sim G(n,p)$ contains at least $\frac{pk^2}{8}$ edges.
	\end{lem}
	Assume the preceding lemma for a moment. Then we can prove the result by Erd\H{o}s.
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:erd_r3k_lb}]
		Here I can motivate the choices of $n$ and $p$ a bit more. Note that the expected number of triangles is $p^3\binom{n}{3}$ which is asymptotically $p^3n^3$, while the number of edges is asymptotically $n^2p$. So that the expected number of edges is the same as the expected number of triangles we would need $p$ to grow like $n^{-1/2}$. Indeed, we would like to delete just enough edges to get rid of all of the triangles; otherwise we might get large independent sets. 
		
		Now we begin the proof. Let 
		\[
			n = \left(\frac{c_1k}{\log k}\right)^2 \,\,\,\text{ and }\,\,\, p= c_2 n^{-1/2} = \frac{c_2}{c_1} \frac{\log k}{k},
		\]
		where $c_1,c_2>0$ are constants to be chosen later. Take $G\sim G(n,p)$ and let $\mathcal{T}$ be a maximal collection of edge-disjoint triangles in $G$.	Define $\tilde{G}$ to be $G$ with all edges contained in a triangle of $\mathcal{T}$ removed. Then $\tilde{G}$ has no triangles. Indeed, if it had a triangle then, by maximality of $\mathcal{T}$, it would have to be a triangle that shares an edge with a triangle in $\mathcal{T}$; but then this triangle would disappear in $\tilde{G}$ (even though it is not part of $\mathcal{T}$).
		
		We will show that 
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k) < 1
		\]
		since this suffices.
		
		Let $Q$ be the event that every set of $k$ vertices of $G$ contains at least $\frac{pk^2}{8}$ edges. By Lemma \ref{lem:high_prob_edges} (with the right choice of constants---we verify this later) we know that $\mathbb{P}(Q) = 1 - o(1)$ where $o(1)\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.
		
		Now note that 
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k) \leq \mathbb{P}(\{\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k\}\cap Q) + \mathbb{P}(Q^{\text{c}}),
		\]
		where $\mathbb{P}(Q^{\text{c}})$ tends to zero. Hence it suffices to show that $\mathbb{P}(\{\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k\}\cap Q)$ is strictly less than one.
		
		But consider the event $\{\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k\}\cap Q$. If this is the case there is some set $S\subset [n]^{(k)}$ of $k$ vertices of $G$ so that $\mathcal{T}$ removes at least $\frac{pk^2}{8}$ edges of $S$ (so that $S$ turns independent in $\tilde{G}$). In other words, $\mathcal{T}$ has at least $\frac{pk^2}{8\cdot 3}$ triangles meeting $S$ in at least two vertices (here we use the assumption that triangles in $\mathcal{T}$ are edge-disjoint). As this is an existential statement (there exists $S$ such that\ldots) it is a union over all $k$-element subsets of $[n]$. Apply the union bound and we get that $\mathbb{P}(\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k)$ is at most $\binom{n}{k}P + o(1)$ where $P$ is defined to be
		\[
		 \mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{T}\text{ has at least }\frac{pk^2}{24}\text{ triangles meeting $[k]$ in at least 2 vertices}\right).
		\]
		Let $\{T_i\}_i$ be the collection of triangles in $K_n$ that meet $[k]$ in at least two vertices, and let $A_i \coloneqq \{T_i\text{ is in }G\}$. Note that if $T_{i_1},\ldots,T_{i_k}$ are edge-disjoint then $A_{i_1},\ldots,A_{i_k}$ are independent.
		
		Next, let $t = \ceil{\frac{pk^2}{24}}$ and take $\mathcal{E}_t$ to be as in Lemma \ref{lem:t_indep_events}, where $\mathcal{F} = \{A_i\}_i$. Then we clearly have
		\begin{align*}
			P \leq \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}_t) &\leq \frac{1}{t!}\left(\sum_{i}\mathbb{P}(T_i\subseteq G)\right)^t\\
			&= \frac{1}{t!}\left(\sum_{i}p^3\right)^t\\
			&= \frac{1}{t!}\left(\binom{k}{2}(n-2) p^3\right)^t\\
			&\leq \frac{1}{t!}(k^2np^3)^t.
		\end{align*}
		Notice that $t!> \left(\frac{t}{e}\right)^t$ as can be easily seen by the Taylor expansion of $e^t$. Hence,
		\begin{align*}
			P &\leq \left(\frac{ek^2np^3}{t}\right)^t\\
			&= (24enp^2)^t\\
			&= (24ec_2^2)^t.
		\end{align*}
		Thus, choosing $c_2$ to be $e^{-1}24^{-1/2}$ we get that $P\leq e^{-t}$. We might as well choose the other constant before finishing off.
		
		Lemma \ref{lem:high_prob_edges} needs us to verify that $pk \geq 16\log n$. We claim that $c_1 \coloneqq \frac{c_2}{48}$ suffices. Indeed,
		\[
			pk = \frac{c_2}{c_1} \log k \geq 48 \log k > 16 \log n
		\]
		since $n < k^2$ by definition. 
		
		Finally, we had 
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{P}(\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k) &\leq \binom{n}{k}P + o(1)\\
			&\leq \binom{n}{k}e^{-t} + o(1)\\
			&\leq \left(\frac{en}{k}\right)^kn^{-k} + o(1),
		\end{align*}
		where we have used the fact that
		\[
			t \geq \frac{pk^2}{24} \geq 2k\log k \geq k\log n.
		\]
		It follows that 
		\begin{align*}
			\mathbb{P}(\alpha(\tilde{G}) \geq k) \leq \left(\frac{e}{k}\right)^k + o(1) \to 0
		\end{align*}
		as $k$ is large. We can get the statement for all $k$ by multiplying by a small constant.
	\end{proof}
	\section{Large Deviation inequalities}
	Let $Z$ be a Gaussian random variable. Then,
	\[
		\mathbb{P}(|Z - \mathbb{E}(Z)| \geq t) \leq e^{\frac{-t^2}{2\Var Z}}.
	\]
	Let $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ be i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. We done this by $X_i\sim \Bern(p)$. Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$. Morally, often the tails of random variables $S_n$ look like Gaussian tails. Note that $\mathbb{E}(S_n) = np$ and $\Var(S_n) = p(1-p)n$
	\begin{thm}[Chernoff inequality]
		Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n \sim \Bern(p)$ and take $S_n$ to be their sum. Then
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(|S_n - pn| \geq t) \leq 2\exp\left(\frac{-t^2}{2pn} + \frac{t^3}{(pn)^2}\right)
		\]
	\end{thm}
	We take this for granted. Then we can prove Lemma \ref{lem:high_prob_edges}.
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:high_prob_edges}]
		Consider the probability $P$ that there is some subset of size $k$ of $G \sim G(n,p)$ that contains strictly less than $\frac{pk^2}{8}$ edges. As this is an existential statement we can apply the union bound, so
		\[
			P \leq \binom{n}{k}\mathbb{P}\left(e(G[k]) < \frac{pk^2}{8} \right),
		\]
		where $e(G[k])$ denotes the number of edges in the subgraph of $G$ induced by $[k]$. Let $P' \coloneqq \mathbb{P}\left(e(G[k]) < \frac{pk^2}{8} \right)$ so that $P \leq \binom{n}{k}P'$. Note that $e(G[k])$ is a sum of $\binom{k}{2}$ i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p$. So 
		\[
			\mathbb{E}(e(G[k])) = p\binom{k}{2}
		\]
		{\color{red}What follows? The proof given in lectures doesn't seem to work.}
	\end{proof}
	\section{The Local Lemma}
	\begin{defn}
		Let $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1,\ldots, A_n\}$ be a family of events in a probability space. A \emph{dependency graph} $\Gamma$  for $\mathcal{F}$ is a graph with a vertex for each even of $\mathcal{F}$ such that for all $i\in[n]$ the event $A_i$ is independent of all events it's not adjacent to.
	\end{defn}
	\begin{rem}
		A dependency graph is not necessarily unique. For example, the complete graph is always a dependency graph.
	\end{rem}
	\begin{thm}[The Local Lemma, Symmetric version]
		Let $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1,\ldots, A_n\}$ be a family of events in a probability space. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a dependency graph for $\mathcal{F}$ with maximum degree $\Delta$.
		
		If
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(A_i) \leq \frac{1}{e(\Delta + 1)},
		\]
		then
		\[
			\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i^c\right) > 0
		\]
	\end{thm}
	By taking complements in the conclusion, we see that this is much better than the union bound, if the hypotheses are satisfied of course. Intuitively, we think of $\mathcal{F}$ as a family of ``bad'' events: the Local Lemma says that there is some (maybe small but positive) chance that no bad event happens. This is useful in situations where the probabilistic method is hard to apply. Indeed, the probabilistic method is good ``for finding the hay in the haystack'', i.e. if some event is likely to happen then we are good. The Local Lemma is good for finding the needle in the haystack, as we will see shortly.
	\begin{thm}[Spencer]
		For all $k$ we have
		\[
			R(k) \geq (1-o(1))\frac{\sqrt{2}}{e}k2^{k/2}
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\varepsilon >0$ and define $n\coloneqq \floor{(1-\varepsilon) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{e} k 2^{k/2}}$. Suppose $\chi$ is a random colouring of $E(K_n)$ (like before, we assume each edge is coloured red or blue with equal probability). Define for $S\in [n]^{(k)}$ the event
		\[
			A_S \coloneqq \{S \text{ is monochromatic in }\chi\}.
		\]
		If we can show that there is a non-zero chance that none of the events in $A_S$ happens then we are done.  This is exactly the conclusion of the Local Lemma. If $\mathcal{F}\coloneqq \{A_S\}_{S\in[n]^{(k)}}$ then define a dependency graph on $\mathcal{F}$ by declaring that $A_S$ is adjacent to $A_T$ iff they share at least one edge. In other words
		\[
			A_S \sim A_T \iff 2 \leq |S\cap T| \leq  k-1.
		\]
		Simple counting reveals that the maximum degree of $\Gamma$ is given by
		\[
			\Delta\coloneqq \sum_{t = 2}^{k-1} \binom{k}{t}\binom{n-k}{k-t}.
		\]	
		On the other hand we clearly have 
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(A_S) = 2^{1 - \binom{k}{2}}
		\]
		for all $S\in [n]^{(k)}$. Therefore the problem is reduced to checking that
		\[
			2^{1 - \binom{k}{2}} \leq \frac{1}{e(\Delta + 1)}
		\] 
		{\color{red}TODO: Complete this check. It's nontrivial, but apparently the first term in the $\Delta$ sum dominates all other terms. We have to use the fact that $n>> k$ somehow.}
		 
	\end{proof}
	How to prove the Local Lemma? It helps to consider a slight generalization, which also has applications on its own
	\begin{thm}[Lopsided Local Lemma]
		Let $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1,\ldots, A_n\}$ be a family of events in a probability space. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a dependency graph for $\mathcal{F}$. Let $0\leq x_1,\ldots,x_n < 1$ be real numbers satisfying
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(A_i) \leq x_i \prod_{j\colon A_j \sim A_i \text{ in }\Gamma}(1-x_j).
		\]
		Then 
		\[
			\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i^c\right) \geq \prod_{i = 1}^{n}(1-x_i) > 0
		\]	
	\end{thm}
	Note that the restriction on $\mathbb{P}(A_i)$ gets stronger as $A_i$ is dependent on more things. If $A_i$ is independent of all other events then we can take it as an isolated vertex in $\Gamma$ and pick $x_i = \mathbb{P}(A_i)$ (assuming this is strictly less than 1). We give one other application before proving the Local Lemmmata.
	\begin{thm}[Erd\H{o}s]
		There is some constant $c>0$ such that for all $k$
		\[
			R(3,k) > c\left(\frac{k}{\log k}\right)^2
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\varepsilon > 0$ and set $n \coloneqq \floor{\varepsilon^4 \left(\frac{k}{\log k}\right)^2}$. Also, define $p \coloneqq \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{n}}$. Consider $G\sim G(n,p)$. For all $T \in [n]^{(3)}$ define the event
		\[
			A_T \coloneqq \{T \text{ is contained in }G\}.
		\]
		Similarly, for all $I\in [n]^{(k)}$ define
		\[
			B_I \coloneqq \{I \text{ is independent in }G\}.
		\]
		We would like to apply the Lopsided Local Lemma to these events. Let $\mathcal{A} \coloneqq \{A_T\}_{T\in[n]^{(3)}}$ and $\mathcal{B} \coloneqq \{B_I\}_{I\in [n]^{(k)}}$. If $\mathcal{F} \coloneqq \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ then we can define a dependency graph on $\mathcal{F}$ by again stating that two events are adjacents if the corresponding graphs share at least one edge. More formally, we declare that
		\begin{align*}
			A_T \sim A_{T'} &\iff |T\cap T'| = 2\\
			A_T \sim B_I &\iff 2\leq |I \cap T| \leq 3\\
			B_I \sim B_{I'} &\iff 2\leq |I\cap I'| < k.
		\end{align*}
		We now note that any $A_T$ has $\binom{3}{2}(n - 3) = 3(n-3)$ neighbours in $\mathcal{A}$; so at most 3n neighbours in $\mathcal{A}$. Similarly, $A_T$ has $\binom{3}{2}\binom{n-3}{k-2} + \binom{n-3}{k-3}$ neighbours in $\beta$, which is at most $4n^{k-2}$.
		
		We do the same calculations for $B_I$. In $\mathcal{A}$ there are $\binom{k}{3} + \binom{k}{2} (n-k)$ neighbours of $B_I$, so at most $nk^2 + k^3$. Similarly, 
		{\color{red}TODO: I can't get the bounds to work in this one}
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Lopsided Local Lemma]
		Note that
		\[
			\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_{i}^c\right) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}\mathbb{P}(A_i^c \mid A_1^c\cap\cdots\cap A_{i-1}^c),
		\]
		which can be seen by induction on $n$ and applying the identity $\mathbb{P}(A\cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B \mid A)$. It follows that
		\[
			\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_{i}^c\right) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} \left(1- \mathbb{P}(A_i \mid A_1^c\cap\cdots\cap A_{i-1}^c)\right)
		\]
		since we have the identity $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A^c \mid B)$. Then it suffices to show that 
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(A_i \mid A_1^c \cap \cdots \cap A_{i-1}^c) \leq x_i
		\]
		for all $i$. So let $i\in [n]$. More generally, we prove that 
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:lll_proof}
			\mathbb{P}\left(A_i \mid \bigcap_{j\in S}A_j^c\right) \leq x_i
		\end{equation}
		for all $S\subseteq [n]$. This we will do by induction on $S$. 
		
		In the base case we have $S = \emptyset$ so (\ref{eq:lll_proof}) is true by hypothesis. Now we do the inductive step. Define
		\[
			\mathcal{I} \coloneqq \bigcap_{j\in S \colon i \nsim j} A_j^c \,\,\,\text{ and }\,\,\, \mathcal{D}\coloneqq \bigcap_{j\in S\colon i\sim j}A_j^c.
		\]
		Note that $A_i$ and $\mathcal{I}$ are independent events. Then
		\begin{align}
			\mathbb{P}\left(A_i \mid \bigcap_{j\in S}A_j^c\right) &= \mathbb{P}(A_i \mid \mathcal{I}\cap \mathcal{D})\notag\\[6pt]
			&= \frac{\mathbb{P}(A_i \cap \mathcal{I}\cap\mathcal{D})}{\mathcal{I}\cap\mathcal{D}}\notag\\[6pt]
			&\leq \frac{\mathbb{P}(A_i \cap \mathcal{I})}{\mathcal{I}\cap\mathcal{D}}\notag\\[6pt]
			&= \frac{\mathbb{P}(A_i) \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{I})}{\mathcal{I}\cap\mathcal{D}}\notag\\[6pt]
			&= \frac{\mathbb{P}(A_i)}{\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}\mid \mathcal{I})}\notag\\[6pt]
			&\leq \frac{x_i \prod_{j\colon j \sim i}(1-x_j)}{\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}\mid \mathcal{I})}\label{eq:lll_ind}		
		\end{align}
		We now write $\mathcal{D} = \bigcap_{k=1}^mA_{i_k}^c$. Hence, by a similar argument as the one we gave at the start,
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}\mid\mathcal{I}) = \prod_{j = 1}^{m} \left(1 - \mathbb{P}(A_{i_j} \mid \mathcal{I}\cap A_{i_1}^c\cap \cdots \cap A_{i_{j-1}}^c)\right).
		\]
		We can apply the induction hypothesis to each factor (since they are conditioned on less than $|S|$ of the events $A_{i}^c$'s). It follows that
		\[
			\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{D}\mid\mathcal{I}) \geq \prod_{j = 1}^{m}(1-x_{i_j}) \geq \prod_{j\colon j \sim i }(1 - x_j).
		\]
		Applying this to (\ref{eq:lll_ind}) finishes the induction.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Symmetric Local Lemma]
		We use the Lopsided Local Lemma with $x_i = \frac{1}{\Delta + 1}$ for all $i$. Note that
		\begin{align*}
			x_i \prod_{j\colon j\sim i}(1- x_j) \geq \frac{1}{\Delta + 1}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\Delta + 1}\right)^\Delta \geq \frac{1}{e(\Delta + 1)} \geq \mathbb{P}(A_i)
		\end{align*}
		so the hypotheses indeed hold.
	\end{proof}
	\section{Upper bounds}
	Thus far we have gotten pretty good lower bounds on $R(3,k)$ but no upper bounds apart from the naive quadratic bound at the beginning of the chapter. 
	\begin{thm}[Ajtai, Kaml√≥s, Szemer√©di]\label{thm:AKS_R3k}
		For all $k$ we have
		\[
			R(3,k) < c \frac{k^2}{\log k}
		\]
	\end{thm}
	First we prove the following theorem.
	\begin{thm}[Ajtai, Kaml√≥s, Szemer√©di]\label{thm:AKS_ind_trian_free}
		Let $G$ be a triangle-free $n$ vertex graph with maximum degree $\Delta$. Then there is some $c>0$ (not depending on $n$ nor $\Delta$) such that $G$ contains an independent set of size at least $c \frac{n}{\Delta} \log \Delta$. In other words,
		\[
			\alpha(G) \geq c \frac{n}{\Delta} \log \Delta
		\]
	\end{thm}
	Note that if we drop the assumption that $G$ is triangle-free then we can get a bound of the form $\frac{n}{\Delta}$. Indeed, perform a random greedy algorithm: at each stage pick a vertex not adjacent to the previous ones. The assumption of triangle-freeness means that the graph is more sparse and hence we get the extra $\log \Delta$ factor. 
	
	We will present two proofs of this theorem, the first due to Shearer\footnote{Warning: Shearer's proof reads like ``***king magic''}. His approach is to first define a function $f\colon [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ so that
	\[
		f(x) \coloneqq \frac{x\ln x - x + 1}{(x-1)^2}
	\]
	for $0< x < 1$, with the boundary values $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1/2$. Note that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $f$ is continuous and (twice) differentiable for $x\geq 0$;
		\item $f(x) \in [0,1]$ for all $x$;
		\item $f'(x) \leq 0$ for all $x$;
		\item $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$;
		\item $f$ always lies above its tangent line, i.e., for all $x,x_0$ we have
		\[
			f(x) \geq f(x_0) + (x - x_0)f'(x_0);
		\]
		\item $f$ satisfies the following differential equation
		\[
			(x+ 1)f = 1 + (x - x^2)f'
		\]
	\end{itemize}
	These facts are not hard to prove using elementary real analysis, but, since this is not a course in real analysis, we skip the details. Shearer then proved the following.
	\begin{lem}[Shearer]
		Let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with average degree $d>0$. Then
		\[
			\alpha(G) \geq nf(d).
		\]
	\end{lem}
	\begin{proof}
		Induction on $n$. For $n = 2$ we can only have $d = 1$ and so we need to show $\alpha(G) \geq 2\frac{1}{2} = 1$ which is obviously true; this finishes the base case.
		
		Now let $x\in V(G)$ be a vertex to be chosen later. Define $G' \coloneqq G - x - N(x)$.  By induction hypothesis we have
		\[
			\alpha(G') \geq (n - d(x) - 1) f(d')
		\]
		where $d'$ is the average degree of $G'$. It follows that
		\begin{align*}
			\alpha(G) &\geq 1 + (n - d(x) - 1)f(d')\\
			&\geq 1 + (n - d(x) - 1)f(d) + (d' - d)f'(d)(n - d(x) - 1) 
		\end{align*}
		since $f$ always lies above its tangent line. Then
		\begin{align*}
			\alpha(G) &\geq nf(d) + 1 - (d(x) + 1)f(d) + (n(d'-d) -d(x)d' - d' + d + d(x)d) f'(d)
		\end{align*}
		Note that
		\begin{align*}
			n(d-d') &= n(\frac{2e(G)}{n} - \frac{2e(G')}{n - d(x) - 1})\\
			&= 2e(G) - (n - d(x) - 1)\frac{2e(G')}{n - d(x) - 1} + (d(x) + 1)d'\\
			&= 2(e(G) - e(G')) + (d(x) + 1)d'\\
			&= 2(\sum_{y\colon y\sim x}d(y)) - (d(x) + 1)d',
		\end{align*}

	\chapter{Hypergraph Ramsey Numbers}
	Recall that an $r$-uniform \emph{hypergraph} $G$ consists of a set of vertices $V(G)$ together with a collection of (hyper)edges $E(G)$ which are subsets of $V(G)$ of size $r$. The graphs we have been discussing thus far are $2$-uniform hypergraphs. 
	
	We define $K_{n}^{(r)}$ to be the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph, i.e.,
	\[
		V(K_{n}^{(r)}) \coloneqq [n] \,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\, E(K_{n}^{(r)}) \coloneqq [n]^{(r)}.
	\]
	We define the $r$-uniform \emph{hypergraph Ramsey numbers} by
	\[
		R^{(r)}(l,k) \coloneqq \min \{n\colon \text{all red/blue colourings of $E(K_{n}^{(r)})$ contain a blue $K_l^{(r)}$ or a red $K_k^{(r)}$}\}.
	\]
	As before we define the $r$-uniform \emph{hypergraph diagonal Ramsey numbers} by $R^{(r)}(k)\coloneqq R^{(r)}(k,k)$.
	\section{Off-diagonal 3-uniform hypergraph Ramsey numbers}
	\begin{thm}[Erd\H{o}s-Rado]
		For all $l,k\in\mathbb{N}$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}(l,k) \leq 2^{\binom{R(l-1,k-1)}{2}}.
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		{\color{red}TODO}
	\end{proof}
	We would like to study $R^{(3)}(4,k)$ since, given the above bound, we can use our knowledge of $R(3,k)$. We get (approximately) something of the form $R^{(3)}(4,k) \leq 2^{ck^4}$. Can we do any better?
	\begin{thm}[Conlon, Fox, Sudakov, 2010]\label{thm:CFS_R^3_4k}
		For all $k$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}(4,k) \leq k^{2k^2}.
		\]
	\end{thm}
	Here is the strategy. The proof of the Erd\H{o}s-Rado bound suggests the following two-player game played on graphs.
	\begin{defn}[The Ramsey Game]
		{\color{red}TODO}
	\end{defn} 
	\begin{lem}
		In the Ramsey Game, the Builder has a strategy that forces a blue $K_3$ or a red $K_{k-1}$ in at most $k^3$ moves. Furthermore, using this strategy at most $k^2$ of the edges revealed  will be blue.
	\end{lem}

	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:CFS_R^3_4k}]

	\end{proof}
	Now we focus on lower bounds. 
	\begin{thm}
		For all $k$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}(4,k) \geq 2^{\frac{k-1}{2}}
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		{\color{red}TODO}
	\end{proof}
	\begin{thm}[Conlon, Fox, Sudakov,2010]
		For sufficiently large $k$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}(4,k) \geq k^{k/5}
		\]
	\end{thm}
	\begin{proof}
		{\color{red}TODO}
	\end{proof}
	\section{Diagonal Multicolour 3-uniform hypergraph Ramsey numbers}
	We will show one result in this direction. By $R^{3}_4(k)$ we mean the minimum number $n$ such that every 4-colouring of $E(K_n^{(3)})$ contains a monochromatic $K_k^{(3)}$.
	\begin{thm}[Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal-Rado, 1965]
		There exists some $c>0$ such that for all $k$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}_4(k) \geq 2^{2^{ck}}.
		\]
	\end{thm}
	This is clearly follows from the next lemma (and the lower bound we had from diagonal Ramsey numbers in the first chapter).
	\begin{lem}
		For all $k$ we have
		\[
			R^{(3)}_4 \geq 2^{R(k-1) - 1}
		\]

	\chapter{The Szemer√©di Regularity Lemma}
	Informally, Szemer√©di Regularity Lemma says that for all $\varepsilon >0$ and $l\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists some $L(\varepsilon,l) \in\mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G$ can be partitioned
	\[
		V(G) = V_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup V_k
	\]
	where $k\leq L(\varepsilon,l)$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $||V_i| - |V_j|| \leq 1$ for all $i,j$; and
		\item the graph between $V_i$ and $V_j$ looks random-like for all but $\varepsilon\binom{k}{2}$ pairs $i,j$.
	\end{itemize}
	We will make this ``random-like'' notion precise.
	\section{The Lemma}
	\begin{defn}[$\varepsilon$-uniform]
		Let $\varepsilon>0$ and $G$ be a graph with some disjoint $X,Y\subseteq V(G)$. We say that the pair $(X,Y)$ is $\varepsilon$\emph{-uniform} iff for all $X'\subseteq X$ and $Y'\subseteq Y$ with $X' \geq \varepsilon |X|$ and $Y' \geq \varepsilon |Y|$ we have
		\[
			|d(X',Y') - d(X,Y)| \leq \varepsilon
		\]
		where we define
		\[
			d(X,Y) = \frac{e(X,Y)}{|X||Y|}.
		\]
	\end{defn}
	Roughly, if $(X,Y)$ is $\varepsilon$-uniform, the bipartite graph they induce is almost regular ($\varepsilon$-regular is a synonym for $\varepsilon$-uniform) in the sense that the density of edges between $X$ and $Y$ stays roughly unchanged if we throw out some vertices from $X$ or $Y$ (but not too many vertices).
	\begin{prop}
		Let $\varepsilon > 0$ and $(X,Y)$ a $\varepsilon$-uniform pair in a graph $G$. If $p = d(X,Y)$, then
		\begin{align*}
			|\{x\in X \colon |N(x) \cap Y| < (p - \varepsilon)|Y|\}| &< \varepsilon |X|\text{ and}\\
			|\{x\in X \colon |N(x) \cap Y| > (p + \varepsilon)|Y|\}| &< \varepsilon |X|
		\end{align*}
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}
		{\color{red}TODO}
	\end{proof}
	\begin{thm}[Embedding Lemma for triangles]
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$, $p\in (0,1)$, and $G$ be a graph. Suppose $V(G)$ can be partitioned by sets $V_1$,$V_2$, and $V_3$ of the same size $m$. Furthermore, assume that these sets are pairwise $\varepsilon$-uniform, and that $d(V_i,V_j) \geq 2\varepsilon$ for all distinct $i,j$. Then there are at least $(1-2\varepsilon)(p-\varepsilon)^3m^3$ triangles in $G$.
 	\end{thm}
 	\begin{proof}
 		{\color{red}TODO}
 	\end{proof}
 	Before stating the Szemer√©di Regularity Lemma we need a couple more definitions.
 	\begin{defn}[Equipartition]
 		For $G$ a graph, we say that a partition
 		\[
 			V(G) = V_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup V_k
 		\]
 		is an \emph{equipartition} if $||V_i| - |V_j|| \leq 1$ for all $i,j\in [k]$.
 	\end{defn}
 	\begin{defn}
 		For $\varepsilon>0$ and $G$ a graph we say that an equipartition of $G$ of size $k$ is $\varepsilon$-uniform if the elements of the partition are pairwise $\varepsilon$-uniform for all but $\varepsilon\binom{k}{2}$ pairs.
 	\end{defn}
 	\begin{thm}[Szemer√©di Regularity Lemma]
 		For all $\varepsilon > 0$ and $l\in\mathbb{N}$ there is some $L(l,\varepsilon) \in\mathbb{N}$ such that every graph has a $\varepsilon$-uniform equipartition with $k$ parts where $l\leq k \leq L(l,\varepsilon)$.
 	\end{thm}
 	Since the proof of this is technical, we will just assume the result.
 	\begin{rem}
 		It is really important that $L(l,\varepsilon)$ does not depend on $G$. The lemma basically does not say anything about graphs with $e(G) = o(n^2)$.
 	\end{rem}
 	\section{Applications}
 	\begin{lem}[Triangle Removal Lemma]
 		For all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta >0$ such that if $G$ is a graph with fewer than $\delta n^3$ triangles, then we can remove $\varepsilon n^2$ edges or less from $G$ to make it triangle free.
 	\end{lem}
 	\begin{proof}
 		{\color{red} TODO}
 	\end{proof}
 	As an application, we prove the celebrated Roth's Theorem.
 	\begin{thm}[Roth's Theorem]
 		For all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists some $n_0\in\mathbb{N}$ so that for all natural numbers $n \geq n_0$ we have that if $A\subseteq [n]$ with $|A| \geq \varepsilon n$, then $A$ contains a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.
 	\end{thm}
 	\begin{proof}
 		{\color{red} TODO}
 	\end{proof}
 	Recall Tur√°n's Theorem.
 	\begin{thm}
 		Let $G$ be a $K_{r+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices, where $r\geq 2$. Then
 		\[
 			e(G) \leq \left(1-\frac{1}{r}\right)\frac{n^2}{2}
 		\]
 	\end{thm}
 	This is sharp for complete multipartite graphs, i.e. Tur√°n graphs.
 	\begin{proof}
 		{\color{red} TODO}
 	\end{proof}
 	\begin{defn}
 		For $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, and a partition 
 		\[
 		V(G) = V_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup V_k
 		\]
 		of a graph $G$, we define the \emph{reduced graph} $R_{\alpha,\varepsilon}$ by
 		\[
 		V(R_{\alpha,\varepsilon}) = \{V_1,\ldots, V_k\}
 		\]
 		and declaring that $V_i \sim V_j$ iff $i\neq j$ and $(V_i,V_j)$ is $\varepsilon$-uniform with $d(V_i, V_j) \geq \alpha$.
 	\end{defn}
 	\begin{thm}[Szemer√©di]
 		For all $\varepsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta >0$  such that if $G$ is a $K_4$-free graph  with $\alpha(G) < \delta n$, then 
 		\[
 			e(G) \leq \frac{n^2}{8} +en^2
 		\]
